twmn
====
A notification system adapted to work with tiling window managers.

Notifications are shown in a one-line bar called the notification slide.

`twmnc` is a command line tool to send notification requests to `twmnd`. Even though twmnc is more powerful, you can still use notify-send to send your notifications. See twmnc --help for more information.

`twmnd` is the daemon listening to notification requests and showing them one after another.

Configuration is done in the INI format in `twmn.conf`, which is usually located at `~/.config/twmn/twmn.conf`. A default configuration is created when `twmnd` is launched for the first time.
